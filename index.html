				<span class="companyname">Experience Studios'</span> Visual Novel:  Sins and Misdeeds
			</p>
			<p>
				The creation of this visual novel involved the following components:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href = "#implement">Implementing Design</a></li>
					<li><a href = "#doc">Documentation</a></li>
					<li><a href = "#development">Development</a></li>
					<li><a href = "#test">Testing</a></li>
					<li><a href = "#q-a">Q/A</a></li>
					<li><a href = "#deploy">Deployment</a></li>
				</ul>
			
			<p>
				<span class="companyname">Experience Studios'</span> visual novel, 'Sins and Misdeeds', began as an idea for 
				a video game, but the limitations imposed by a pandemic, deadlines, financial resources, available equipment, and staff, 
				made it necessary to downsize my original concept from a video game to a visual novel.
			</p>
			<h2 id="implement">Implementing Design</h2>
			<p>
				After deciding to produce a visual novel that kept the general concept of the video game, I selected my team. 
            </p>
            <p>			
					My team consisted on myself and my father.  Together we transposed the main ideas of the proposed video game to the visual novel.  
					I created a general outline of how the story would flow and supplied the dialog.  Working as a team, my father and I matched pictures to dialog.
			</p>
			<h2 id="doc">Documentation</h2>
			<p>
				 My father and I selected and modified pictures, 
					mainly covers, from various public domain comic books in his collection.  The music used in this production is also in the 
					public domain.  Artists were credited when known. 
			</p>
			<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
			<p>
				We selected Ren'py as our development engine.  We added pictures and dialog as outlined in the examples and tutorials for the 
				developmental engine.  Neither my father nor I have ever written code for Python, so we learned as we went along.
			<p>
			<h2 id="test">Testing</h2>
				Testing of the game was an ongoing process that involved the entire team.  As soon as a few lines of code were written, 
				we would run it, checking for errors in coding.  Many times, the code did not execute as expected or did not execute at all.  
				Usually the problem was easy to find, a missing quotation mark or a semicolon instead of a colon.  Once the code executed properly, 
				we check the dialog for spelling, errors in grammar and consistency of character names.
			
			<h2 id="q-a">Q/A</h2>
			
			
			<p>In Q/A also known as Quality Assurance, was my job my assignment for the team.  My tasks included the following things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Test the visual novel game</li>
				<li>Check the visual novel game for the bugs and glitches not found during the initial development.</li>
				<li>Make check list of bugs and glitches.</li>
				<li>Submit check list to them to make corrections.</li>
				<li>Using check list as guide, check off the items on list that have been if corrected and verify that the glitches or bugs are no longer in the game, if not, leave unchecked.  </li>
				<li>Document what was checked off and record any new bugs or glitches found in the visual novel this time.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2 id="deploy">Deployment</h2>
			
			<p>The Uploading and Publishing the visual novel required my completion of the following steps:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create an account with Itchio.</li>
				<li>Create the page within the Itchio site where I can upload the visual novel.</li>
				<li>Upload the visual novel to the site.</li>
				<li>Post a description of the visual novel on my Itchio page</li>
			</ul>
