			<h2>Visual Novel:  Sins and Misdeeds - Trends</h2>
 
		<p>
			<span class="companyname">Experience Studios</span>  -  An analysis and critique the trends in game design and game technology and how they affect game and visual novel projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Cloud Gaming:</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Decades ago, video games consisted of computer game on floppy disk, console games on cartridge or disc.  Today, computer and console games can still be purchased for computer or console on a disc specifically for that type of machine, but the majority of games are now downloaded directly to the console or computer.  In addition, today’s gamers also have the option of cloud gaming. 
		</p>
		<p>
		    Cloud gaming, a method of playing video games or enjoying visual novels using remote hardware.  Sometimes the game is played using the servers are owned by the company that manufacturers the game.  At other times, the servers may be owned by a separate company that acts as host for the game.  Rather than the player downloading the game onto their system or installing it from disc or other physical media and playing it locally, cloud gaming relies on the internet to deliver via streaming the game to the players’ device of choice.  This makes it possible to play games on devices that are incapable of running the game locally due to a lack the internal hardware necessary to power the games.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the game to operate properly, cloud gaming requires persistent internet connection.  None of the information, including saved data, is stored on the user’s gaming system, but rather, remotely.  For gamers with less than ideal computer connections, game play using cloud gaming as game play becomes difficult or impossible as connection to the server must be reestablished whenever it is lost.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
		<p>
			Visual novels usually don not require the computing power that some games require, but they do require memory.  Using cloud gaming to allow the user to read a visual novel using a streaming service rather than downloading it to their device reduces the resources used by the user’s device. 
        </p>
		<br>
		<p> 
			<b>Virtual Reality</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Virtual Reality refers to a computer-generated three-dimensional world and its environment in which the user is free to explore, interact, manipulate objects, and perform various actions.  Various devices exist that can be used to create this illusion of reality:  Headsets, Omni-directional treadmills, Special gloves, and many more.  Increases in usage of this technology as well advancement in this technology has resulted in the lowering of the price of various Virtual Reality products.  
		</p>
		<p>
			The increase demand for smartphones complement the growing sale of Virtual Reality headsets  that relay of the smartphones’ size capability to display video, in this case, slightly different side by side images, one for each eye, that produce a three-dimensional image.  
		</p>
		<p>
			A lack of awareness about Virtual Reality technology, compatibility issues with Virtual Reality devices and Virtual Reality consoles , and the high initial investment cost of the equipment the creators need to produce the games as well as the user equipment needed to produce immenseness and realism in the virtual world.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
		
		<br>
		<p> 
			<b>Augmented Reality</b>
		</p>
		<p> 
		    Augmented Reality refers to a technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's device's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view on their device of an enhanced version of the real physical world through the use of visual elements.  Sound or other sensory stimuli maybe added to further enhance the user's perception of being in an alternate environment.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
			A few augmented reality systems require specialized headsets similar to those required by virtual reality gamers, but most augmented reality games can be played on devices like smartphones, tablets, and portable gaming systems.   Augmented reality game often display on the user’s device superimposes computer generate environment or objects on top of a user’s actual environment.<sup>3</sup>
		</p>
		<p>
			Augmented reality games can be as simple as a game of virtual checkers played on a table surface or as immersive as ‘Pokemon Go’, the world’s most popular augmented reality game.  However, augmented Reality’s use is not restricted to the gaming community, it has become a major component of many marketing campaigns from the home improve industry, hair salons, eye ware, and clothing, all have in use smartphone apps that allow the user to see the what the finished product would look like by superimposing the image of their product onto the consumers’ smartphone image.<sup>4</sup>  
		</p>
		<p> 
			<b>Conclusion</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, there are no virtual visual novels or ugemented reality visual novels on the market, but several companies are working on creating virtual visual novels that will allow the user/reader to become a part of the story.
